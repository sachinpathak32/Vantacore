# Vantacore
An ancient relic, a broken bloodline, and a nation on the brink. As VANTACORE awakens in the heart of Nepal, a family is thrust into a war of myth, power, and betrayal. Destiny clashes with rebellion in a battle to decide the fate of the world. “If Nepal can’t be mine, it will belong to no one.”
